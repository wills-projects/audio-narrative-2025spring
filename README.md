This is the future website for William Lee's audio narrative.
It tells the story of a man that is waking up on a seemingly regular sunday morning. He lazily gets out of bed waking up late to his alarm, and begins to make breakfast. However, we are interrupted by a knock at the door, in which we find the man is being arrested in a twist for trafficking illegal substances and squatting in somebody else's home. Crazy!
