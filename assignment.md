# Project 1: Audio Narrative
 
Your task in this unit is to **arrange layers of sound to convey a sense of place and story.** In assigning this, I have two main goals for you: (1) to learn how to capture sound and edit it using digital tools, and (2) to explore the affordances of sound as a medium, with particular attention to its ability to communicate *immersive environment* and *narrative pacing and change*. The genre of the narrative you convey is open: it could be documentary, fictional, even science-fictional. (The title you choose will help steer listeners' expectations, and thus their perceptions.)

As you start planning your composition, consider: in what place (physical, virtual, or imaginary) could you anchor your soundscape? What kinds of stories happen there, and which of them could you reasonably tell within a few minutes? How can you represent that environment sonically? What sounds are relatively stable, or sustained, and what is incidental? What structures or sequences could help a listening audience follow?

You don't need answers to all of these questions before getting started, but asking them early and returning to them often could help you get a sense of the soundscape you want to make.

## Generative constraints
_(to be updated together in lesson 6)_

### Baseline Criteria
For a minimum grade of B, all projects for this unit must…
* Play for 2-4 minutes
* Have something happen or change during the piece (e.g. a shift in location, a discrete event)
* Contain at least one sound originally recorded by you
* Contain at least one sound not recorded by you, but which you have permission (e.g. Creative Commons license, fair use, etc) to use
* List and credit file sources used, including your means of establishing permission
* Have three layers (tracks) of sound overlapping at least once in the file
* Meet deadlines and requirements from the chart below (see: citation, reflection, project title in README)
* Export a playable ("rendered") .mp3 file


### Aspirational Inspirations
To target (but not guarantee) a grade above a B, the best projects for this unit may…
* Use relative volume and other effects to signal distance
* Use left/right pan and low/high pass filters to create a sense of (locations in) space
* Have a clear organizational scheme you can articulate in your reflection
  - e.g. Seamlessly blend clips from disparate sources
  - e.g. Use sharp cuts to signal scene changes
  - e.g. Have an emotional or intellectual arc reflected in background music
  - etc.
* Show evidence (e.g. from workshop feedback) that audience interpretation matches what you intended
* Use Audacity effects or tools that are new to you
* Write clear commit messages that signal your process and progress



## Deadlines and products
At each stage, unless otherwise specified, upload (push) your materials to _your own forked copy_ of this assignment repository. I recommend that you **save often, using meaningful commit messages**; for best results, please keep your filenames clear, lowercase, and space-free (use hyphens or underscores).

Unless otherwise noted, materials are expected by 10pm on the following dates, so I can begin reviewing them before class the next day.

| date | what's due | expected files |

| Sun Jan 26 | Audio Narrative Proposal | Thinking in writing about what you'd like to do for this assignment, posted to the the designated forum on the [Issue Queue](https://github.com/benmiller314/cdm2022spring/issues). This post should include:<ul><li>some basic premise of your narrative;</li><li>some sense of setting; and</li><li>a link to your repository, which is the fork of this assignment.</li></ul> In addition, please add to your repo (either in README.md or a new file) a **prospective assets chart** as per *Writer/Designer* p. 149 (see the Files page on <a href="https://canvas.pitt.edu/courses/296641" title="Limited circulation in keeping with fair use of this excerpt">Canvas</a>). <div class="alert alert-warning">Not sure where to start? Try one of the <a href="#parachute-prompts">"parachute prompts"</a> below.</div>|
| Tues Jan 28 | Audio Narrative Preview | An early snapshot of your progress, to get the gears turning. Turn in: <ul><li>A layered **Audacity project file (.aup3)**, showing the arrangement of your sounds so far (need not be a complete soundscape or narrative yet).</li><li>A static **[screenshot](https://www.take-a-screenshot.org/) (.png or .jpg)** of your Audacity file in progress (for comparison later to subsequent drafts).</li><li> A plain text (.txt) or markdown (.md) file, explaining in at least 300 words **what you're showing us** in this preview. Feel free also to ask questions or lay out next steps for yourself!</li><li> An updated list of assets, now with the files you actually recorded or otherwise obtained. <ul><li>Add source documentation for any outside sources – and your permission to use them (e.g. licenses, fair use; see *Writer/Designer* p. 160-165). This may be in a separate file or as part of your README.</li></ul></li></ul> |
| Sun Feb 2 | Audio Narrative Draft | A solid attempt at a complete audio narrative, ideally at the target length. Turn in:<ul><li>A layered **Audacity project file (.aup3)**, showing the arrangement of your sounds so far</li><li>At least one more static **[screenshot](https://www.take-a-screenshot.org/) (.png or .jpg)** of your Audacity file in progress. <ul><li>When to screenshot? Moments that seem worth remembering as you go: where did you level up, or realize something, or get stuck?</li></ul></li><li>An **updated README.md file**, introducing the project to a new audience beyond our class.</li><li>An **updated list of credits**, including documentation of any outside sources – and your permission to use them (e.g. licenses, fair use); see *Writer/Designer* p. 160-165.</li></ul>  |
| Sun Feb 9 | Audio Narrative Final Draft target | Include the same  components as in the earlier draft, but updated. |
| Mon Feb 10, <em>at noon</em> | Audio Narrative Reflection and Final Draft firm deadline | Give a sense of the work you put into your narrative and whether it accomplishes what you wanted it to. Turn in: <ul><li>at least 500 words describing the work you did</li><li>at least two screenshots showing your work in progress</li><li>at least one screenshot of feedback that you responded to in revising (and please say how)</li><li>your own assessment of how you met the baseline criteria for the class, as well as aspirational criteria as appropriate </li></ul> **Post your reflections to the designated forum on the course site's [Issue queue](https://github.com/benmiller314/cdm2025spring/issues)**, to make it easier to embed images. (If you want to then copy the source code into a file in your own repo called reflections.md, I won't stop you!) |


## Setup

1. Fork this repository to create a new version you can control.
2. This will give you an online copy, but for editing purposes you'll definitely want a local copy on your computer. [Follow the cloning instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) for your operating system, making sure to put the cloned folder in a place on your computer where you can easily find it. Save all your changes into that folder so Git and GitHub Desktop can find them.
3. Because some sound files can take up a lot of space, you may want to use [Git Large File Storage](https://git-lfs.github.com/), an add-on service that lets you designate certain file extensions as worth tracking and storing off-site, rather than directly in your repository.
   * If you want to do this, it's pretty easy! You'll just need to run a few commands at the [command line](https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/intro_to_command_line/) to make it work.
   * Simply **go to https://git-lfs.github.com, download, and follow the two steps on the screen!**
   * Once it's set up at the command line, git-lfs will also work through GitHub Desktop.
   * For this assignment, the key filetype to store offsite is most likely `*.aup3`.

## Parachute Prompts

As it says above, the genre, subject, and setting for this project are up to you. But if you're stuck for where to start, try one of these options:

* **Day in the Life of...** Over the course of a few days, record 40 or more 5-second snippets of sound that tell us where you are and what you're doing. (The challenge will be to make at least some of these sounds different from everyone else's: parts of a particular soundscape, not a generic one.) Overlay a soundtrack that shows your energy – or the energy you'd like to have; fiction is fair game, after all – at various times of day. *Human voices, including yours, are welcome!*
* **Interview for a Podcast** You know that one friend or family member who's always telling great stories? Ask them for a new one, or to re-tell one of your favorites, and this time, get it on "tape." Record more than you'll need, then go to the editing room to recreate the story in sound: boil it down to highlights, introduce your speaker and yourself, then add a background track and incidentals to round out the sonic atmosphere. To really get that journalistic feel, feel free to record commentary as you listen back, and interject your "present" self in amidst the "past" self's conversation with your interviewee.
